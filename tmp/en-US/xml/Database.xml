			On RHEL and CentOS, MySQL does not set a root password by default. It is very strongly recommended that you set a root password as a security precaution. Run the following commands, and substitute your own desired root password for passwd. 
<screen># service mysqld start

# mysql -u root

mysql&gt; SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('passwd');</screen>

			CloudStack supports database replication from one MySQL node to another. Creating a replica is not a backup solution. You should develop a backup procedure for the MySQL data that is distinct from replication.

			Edit my.cnf on the master and add the following in the [mysqld] section below datadir.
		</para>
		 
<screen>log_bin=mysql-bin
server_id=1</screen>
		 <para>
			The server_id must be unique with respect to other servers. The recommended way to achieve this is to give the master an ID of 1 and each slave a sequential number greater than 1, so that the servers are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.
