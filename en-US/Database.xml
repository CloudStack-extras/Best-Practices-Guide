		<title>Security</title>
		<para>On RHEL and CentOS, MySQL does not set a root password by default. It is very strongly recommended that you set a root password as a security precaution. Run the following commands, and substitute your own desired root password for passwd.

<screen># service mysqld start

# mysql -u root

mysql> SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('passwd');</screen>

        <section id="sect-Best_Practices_Guide-Database-Replication">
		<title>Replication</title>
		<para>CloudStack supports database replication from one MySQL node to another.  Creating a replica is not a backup solution. You should develop a backup procedure for the MySQL data that is distinct from replication.</para>
		<para>Edit my.cnf on the master and add the following in the [mysqld] section below datadir.</para>
		<screen>log_bin=mysql-bin
server_id=1</screen>
		<para>The server_id must be unique with respect to other servers. The recommended way to achieve this is to give the master an ID of 1 and each slave a sequential number greater than 1, so that the servers are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.</para>
