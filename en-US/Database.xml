		<para>On RHEL and CentOS, MySQL does not set a root password by default. It is very strongly recommended that you set a root password as a security precaution. Run the following commands, and substitute your own desired root password for passwd.

<screen># service mysqld start

# mysql -u root

mysql> SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('passwd');</screen>
