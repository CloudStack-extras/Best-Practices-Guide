		<title>Recommended Limits</title>
		<para>
			In order to maintain an efficient cloud, Citrix recommends the following logical limits when building your cloud:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>A maximum of six hosts per cluster.  You can have a virtually unlimited number of clusters per pod and the number of storage pools per cluster does not matter.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>No more than 200 virtual disks per LUN.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Each hypervisor supports a maximum number of virtual machines per host.  It is important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>There are no practical limits on SRs per cluster.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>It is also important to take into consideration host downtime.  To maintain uptime wherever possible your cloud should be designed to have a host go down and have all VMs on that host migrate over to other hosts without violating the above recommendations.</para>
