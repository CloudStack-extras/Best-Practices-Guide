	<title>Hypervisor Hosts</title>
	<para>
		<indexterm><primary>hosts</primary></indexterm>Hosts are where the action takes place.  When CloudStack receives an instruction to create a virtual machine (VM) it polls all the hosts in a particular cluster in search of one that can handle the CPU and RAM demands of the VM.  The hosts run the VMs using the hypervisor software.

		<title>Setting up your hosts</title>
		<para><indexterm><primary>hosts</primary><secondary>setup</secondary></indexterm>It is increadibly important that the host hardware is identical with respect to the processors, number of network interface cards (NICs), and the way the network is setup on all hosts within a cluster.  VMs that are setup in one configuration will expect the same hardware to be present if it is migrated to another host.</para>

		<title>Host Capacity and Overprovisioning</title>
		<para>
			<indexterm><primary>hosts</primary><secondary>overprovisioning</secondary><indexterm>Host capacity should generally be modeled in terms of RAM for the guests.  Storage and CPU may be overprovisioned.  RAM may not.  RAM is usually the limiting factor in capacity designs.
